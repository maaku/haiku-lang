"""A conceptual dummy type which is the proper subtype of every type except
itself, and a proper supertype of none. Arguing whether any value exists for
the `Omega` is a bit like arguing how many angels could fit on the head of a
pin. For practical purposes, the omega type has one value representing the
absence of value (not unlike the Python keyword `None`), and all instances of
the omega type are this value, represented as an empty byte array."""

Omega = type(None)
